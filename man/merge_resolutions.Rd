\title{Merge Partitions from different Resolutions}
\usage{
merge_resolutions(res_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{res_obj}{A list associated to a configuration field from the object
returned by the \code{assess_clustering_importance} method.}
}
\value{
A list having one field assigned to each number of clusters. A number
of cluster will contain a list of all merged partitions. To avoid duplicates,
\code{merged_partitions} with threshold 1 is applied.
}
\description{
Merge partitions obtained with different resolution values. The
partitions will be grouped based on the number of clusters. The identical
partitions will be merged into a single partition by updating the frequency
using the \code{merge_partitions} method.
