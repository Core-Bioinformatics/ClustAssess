[["sandbox-tab.html", "Chapter 7 Sandbox tab 7.1 UMAPs 7.2 Jaccard Simmilarity Index (JSI)/Cells per cluster", " Chapter 7 Sandbox tab Just like the previous tab, this tab will allow you to compare two different configurations against each other in the same way as before. Here, we allow you to select any two configurations you want to compare. We do not allow the option of downloading these configurations, as we are trying to encourage you to go through the initial tabs and make a sensible and informed decision as to which partition you want to proceed with. However, if you wish to compare any two configurations, we allow this inside the sandbox tab. In this tab, we also include the option to change the colour scheme of the plots based on a user-selected colour palette. 7.1 UMAPs Main Plots Figure 7.1: UMAP plots for comparison between any two configurations. Please note that this tab is not meant to influence your choice of final configuration.
