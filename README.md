# The Tools

## Proportion of Ambiguously Clustered Pairs (PAC)
To assess clustering robustness, the proportion of ambiguously clustered pairs
(PAC) [1] uses a consensus clustering. The rate of element co-clustering is
recorded across various numbers of clusters, *k*. The lower the PAC, the stabler
the clustering for that *k*.

ClustAssess uses a heirarchical clustering as base for the consensus clustering,
and an optimized Rcpp [2] implementation to compute the PAC values. To
calculate PAC, we write:

`cc_res = consensus_cluster(your_data, n_reps=50, k_max=20, p_sample=0.8, p_feature=0.8)`

It is important that the PAC has converged before using it to assess your data;
the `pac_convergence` function can be used to visualize the PAC curves across
iterations:

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess/main/docs/articles/ClustAssess_files/figure-html/pac-1.png width=80%/>

As the curves have evened out, we surmize that PAC has converged in this case.
If the PAC has not converged, increase the `n_reps` value.

If the dataset contains >1000 elements, we recommend calculating a geometric
sketch [3] of your data of size <1000, and running PAC on that sketch.

A local minimum in the PAC landscape, as visualized below using the
`pac_landscape` function, can be interpreted as an optimal *k* for the dataset:

## Element Centric Clustering Similarity (ECS)
Element-centric similarity (ECS) [4] is a per-observation measure of clustering
similarity. Briefly, ECS is obtained by constructing a cluster-induced element
graph, and subsequently calculating the stationary probability distribution of
a random walk with restarts (also known as a personalized Pagerank) over the
elements.

In addition to providing per-element information on clustering agreement, ECS
avoids several pitfalls associated with other measures of clustering
similarity (refer to [4] for more detail).

To compare two clusterings with ECS, we use the `element_sim_elscore` function:

`ecs = element_sim_elscore(clustering_result1, clustering_result2, alpha=0.9)`

where `1-alpha` is the restart probability of the random walk. We can
subsequently visualize the ECS on a PCA of the data:

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess/main/docs/articles/comparing-soft-and-hierarchical_files/figure-html/ecs-2.png width=80%/>

In addition to flat disjoint clusterings (like the result of k-means for
example), ClustAssess can also compare overlapping clusterings and hierarchical
clusterings; refer to the `comparing-soft-and-hierarchical` vignette for more
detail.

Besides comparing two clusterings with `element_sim_elscore`, ClustAssess
also enables computing the per-element consistency (aka frustration) between a
set of clusterings with the `element_consistency` function, and comparing a set
of clusterings with a ground truth partitioning of elements with the
`element_agreement` function.


## Marker Gene Overlap
In the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, cluster marker genes are typically
used to infer the cell type of clusters. However, two different clustering
results may lead to two different sets of markers for the cells. The
`marker_overlap` function allows the comparison of two sets of markers. The
output can be either as the number of common marker genes per cell, or as
Jaccard similarity (size of intersect divided by size of union) per cell.

## Stability-Based Parameter Assessment
The most common clustering pipeline for single-cell data consists of
constructing a nearest-neighbor graph of the cells, followed by community
detection to obtain the clustering. This pipeline is available in multiple
single-cell toolkits, including Seurat, Monocle v3, and SCANPY.
ClustAssess provides several methods to assess the stability of parameter
choices that influence the final clustering, for example to evaluate feature
sets, we use `get_feature_stability_object`, and plot the results with
`plot_feature_stability_boxplot`:

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess/main/docs/articles/stability-pipeline-description_files/figure-html/stab_boxplot-1.png width=80%/>

where the higher element-centric consistency (ECC) indicates more stable
clustering results across random seeds. For more details, please see [this
vignette](https://core-bioinformatics.github.io/ClustAssess/articles/stability-pipeline-description.html).

## Interactive Visualization of the Stability Assessment and Downstream Analysis

Another feature of the package consists in providing a Shiny application where
the user can interactively visualize the stability assessment of the clustering
and perform some downstream analysis steps on the dataset without prior R
knwoledge. The application is divided into three major components:
- Stability Assessments: the user is presented with the assessment of the
clustering stability for each of the three steps of the PhenoGraph pipeline.
This component is structured in three tabs, one for each step. The user is 
prompted to select the stable configurations in order to proceed to the next
section.
- Comparison of configuration and downstream analysis: the user can visually
assess the clustering results and the pattern on expression based on the
variety of visualisations provided in this section, which contains UMAP plots
(A - one or multiple gene expression, B - metadata distribution),
violin and boxplots (G), gene expression pseudobulk heatmap and bubbleplots (E),
metadata association heatmaps (C). The biological interpretation is enhanced by
the possibility of identifying the marker genes for each cluster (F) and the
enrichment analysis of the detected differentially expressed genes (H). The app
allows custom annotation of the clusters and the already existing metadata (D).
- Sandbox: this tab provides more flexibility for the user in temrs of the
selected configuration. This approach is available, but not encouraged, as the
results might not be stable and reproducible. This tab also contains elements
such as panels for changing the colourscheme of the figures.

The application can be generated using the output of the
`automatic_stability_assessment` function and a normalised expression matrix.


# Handling Large Datasets
If your dataset is large, the runtime for the tools described above may be
prohibitive. In these cases, we recommend subsampling your data using geometric
sketching [3]. In R, the subsampling can be done via reticulate:

`geosketch <- reticulate::import('geosketch')`

assuming data.embed contains a dimensionality reduction of your data, you can
then call:

`sketch.indices <- geosketch$gs(data.embed, sketch.size, one_indexed = TRUE)`

and use the resulting indices for your subsample. For PAC, subsampling to <1000 cells
should help, and for ECS and data assessment functions, <5000 cells may be
appropriate (and parallelization can further help reduce the runtime).
